# Skilling Champion extension

This extensions allows you to copy a link / page url with your Skilling Champion CreatorID.

It ensures that the CreatorID is correctly added to the URL, so you don't have to worry about whether the URL already contains a query. It also provides the option to make English URL "language neutral" by removing "en-us" - this will enable most Microsoft sites to detect the preferred language of the user and serve the content in that language.



## Usage

### 1. Configure Options

After you have installed the extension, please specify your CreatorIDs within the extension options:

![Extension Options](./assets/screenshot_options.png)

You can also check "Make English URLs language-neutral" or "Make language-specific URLs language-neutral" to make your links more friendly to a global audience. These language-neutral URLs will allow the destination website to match the user's language preference. 
The first option will only transform English URLs (that contain "en-us") while the second will transforms URLs of any language.

### 2. Use the extension

After you have specified your CreatorID you will have two options to create a link including your CreatorID

* **Copy a page url** - right click anywhere on a [suitable page](#suitable-sites) and select "*Copy page url with CreatorID*"
